// The café's menu, from the owner's printed menus (PDFs + Tea & Coffee card, 10 Oct 2026).
// `pnpm db:seed` only adds what is missing; `pnpm menu:load` overwrites the menu with this file
// (photos are kept). Day to day, the owner edits the menu in the dashboard.
//
// Not on the printed menus, so filled in here:
// - Items with no price yet (overnight oats, sandwiches, MRP drinks) are in `hiddenUntilPriced`:
//   added but hidden from guests until the owner enters a price and shows them.
// - Two-size dishes (toasts, smoothies) are separate items. The 250 ml smoothies' protein and
//   kcal are scaled from the 350 ml figures – the menu gives no numbers for the small size.
// - Add-ons have no nutrition on the menu, so theirs is 0.
